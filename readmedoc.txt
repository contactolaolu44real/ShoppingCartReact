Install node js on your system. I included it already in the folder.
After installation, open your comand prompt and type npm install --save react
After installing, copy the project named my-app int the folder to any location you want.
Open the whole folder of my-app in any editor of your choice. Preferably, VSCode.
So go to VS code terminal and open it.
After, type npm install to install all the packages needed.(U can do this same thing if u dont have VsCode
by going on command prompt and change directris to the folder of your my-app). So type npm install
